# EstimationMethods
Project for a class (4-th year undergrad, HEP, Data Estimation Methods)

Part1 has a `gui.py` built with tkinter. Use args.txt to set up a spectrum from a file.
Part1 forms HPGe detector spectrum based on the specified information.

Part2 contains script `apectum_analysis.py` that searches peaks and estimates their parameters.
